# Technical Screening Challenges

Thank you for your interest in working with us!  Before we get too far into the process, it's important that we get a feel for how you approach software development.  This repository contains a handful of folders, each with a different challenge that is relevant to the various aspects of software development - design patterns, logical thinking, "maintainable" code, automated testing, and even requirements gathering.  

As you complete the challenges, please keep in mind that there are no right or wrong answers - just provide your solution as honestly as possible, using whatever tools you'd use on the job (Google, Stack Overflow, your buddy next to you, etc.).  The only "rule" is that you complete the challenges yourself and that the results reflect the solutions that you'd find acceptable in a real-world scenario.

Thank you for taking the time to complete this very important part of the hiring process.  We appreciate it.
